# designing-pubg-player-database
This dir contains a PUBG (=PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, an online shooter game) group project I worked on as part of the Managing Data Resources (IS 465) class at Boston University in Spring 2018. What we did:
1. Designed a fictional relational database for the game
2. Generated life-like data entries
3. Populated the database with those entries
4. Designed meaningful SQL queries into the data.
