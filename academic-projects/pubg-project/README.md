# pubg-project
This directory contains a PUBG (i.e. PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, an online multiplayer shooter game) group project I worked on as part of the Managing Data Resources (IS 465) class I took at Boston University in Spring 2018. This project entails:
1. Designing a fictional database for the game
2. Generating life-like data entries
3. Populating the database with those entries
4. Designing meaningful SQL queries into the data.
