This directory contains a Sentiment Analysis project concerning United Airlines customers. This was a group project as part of the Large Scale Computing with Hadoop (BU.330.740) graduate class I took at Johns Hopkins Carey Business School in Spring 2020. The project entails:
1. Building a Natural Language Processing model for analyzing United Airlines customer sentiment on Twitter based on two data mining methods: 
  * Logistic Regression
  * Recurrent Neural Network with Long Short-Term Memory (RNN with LSTM).
