# puppetry-project
This repo contains various Python notebooks and data visualizations that I produced for [Michel Anteby](http://www.bu.edu/questrom/profile/michel-anteby/) - a Boston University professor of organizational behavior and sociology - doing research on puppeteers and how their profession is being affected by the emergence of CGI and other special effects in the film industry. I did this work as a Computer Programmer for the BU Questrom School of Business IT Services in Summer 2018.
