# puppetry-project
This folder contains various Python notebooks and data visualizations that I produced for Michel Anteby - a Boston University professor of organizational behavior and sociology - doing research on puppeteers and how their profession was affected by the emergence of CGI and other special effects in the film industry. I did this work as an IT Consultant for the BU Questrom School of Business IT Services in Summer 2018.
